# Simulation-of-a-kitting-operation-in-Gazebo-using-ROS2

Project Description:

The project involves implementing a system to automate order fulfillment in a warehouse using robots, cameras, and AGVs. The process begins with the system reading and processing orders, determining the required items, quantities, and any specific instructions. Cameras are strategically placed to capture data on the items and their locations, which provide the pose of the object. The next step is to retrieve the necessary components based on this data, gather specific information about these parts, and place them on a tray. Subsequently, the tray is positioned on an AGV, and the AGV is dispatched to the warehouse.

The environment image is attached below.
